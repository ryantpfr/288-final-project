1. the servo works by using an error amplifier to send the difference between the supplied voltage and the potentiometer voltage
	to the motor. This results in the servo always moving towards the intnded position.

16 mHz -> 62.5  ns
20 ms -> 20,000,000 ns

20,000,000 / 62.5 = 320,000 clock cycles


4. when the servo is non inverted 0v is the max in one direction and Vmax is the max in the other.
	therefore the central position is the average of the two voltages
